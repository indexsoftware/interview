# PHP Question
In this folder, you will find an index.php file. In this file there is a CSV which will need to be parsed.

In the function which is provided from line 19, you will need to implement a function which splits the CSV into an array.

If you do this correctly the file will output one array with the split CSV values and two consequent OK values all separated by newline
